    <h1> A Story of Global Health and Economic Development</h1>
    <p>In this data-driven narrative, we explore the relationship between life expectancy, GDP per capita, and
        population across the world. We use data from the UNICEF and the World Bank to visualize these relationships.
    </p>

    <h3>Life Expectancy at Birth Over Time for Afghanistan</h3>
    <p>We start with a line chart that shows the life expectancy at birth for Afghanistan over time. The chart reveals
        that life expectancy has increased over the years, but there have been some fluctuations. In recent years, life
        expectancy has been around 63 years.</p>

    <h3>GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy at Birth in 1980</h3>
    <p>Next, we explore the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy across the world. We create a world
        map chart using data from the UNICEF and the World Bank. The chart shows the GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)
        by country. The chart highlights that most high-income countries are located in North America, Europe, and parts
        of Asia, while low-income countries are mainly located in Africa. Interestingly, some low-income countries such
        as Rwanda and Ethiopia have shown significant economic growth over the years</p>

    <h3>the relationship between population and GDP per capita</h3>
    <p>We then investigate the relationship between population and GDP per capita. We merge the UNICEF and the World
        Bank datasets and create a scatter plot of GDP per capita against population. The chart reveals that there is no
        clear relationship between population and GDP per capita. Some high-population countries such as China and India
        have lower GDP per capita compared to some low-population countries such as Qatar and Luxembourg.</p>

    <h3>the mean GDP per capita by country</h3>
    <p>Lastly, we examine the mean GDP per capita by country. We create a bar chart using data from the UNICEF and the
        World Bank. The chart shows that the top-ranking countries in terms of GDP per capita are mainly located in
        Europe and North America, while the lowest-ranking countries are mainly located in Africa. The chart also
        highlights that some low-income countries such as Rwanda and Ethiopia have shown significant economic growth
        over the years.

    <h4 style="color:#00008B ">In conclusion, our data-driven narrative highlights the complex relationship between
        global health and economic development. While there are some trends, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to
        economic growth and development. Each country has unique challenges and opportunities that require tailored
        solutions. By exploring data, we can better understand these complexities and develop informed policies to
        improve global health and economic well-being.</h2>
